Saria comes from another world in order to help you on your adventure!
She is a powerful summon that offers a plethera of abilities beyond just combat AND each of these abilities have strengths and weaknesses depending on what biome the player is in! 

New recipes for vanilla potions through the use of cooking pots and this mods XPpearls.

Changed pretty much everything! Xp pearls now drop rarely from enemies and you can use them to level up Saria.
Saria will now level up as you battle with her and once a checkpoint is reached she will get much stronger as well as gaining a new attack!
Craft a HealBall to Summon her and an XpStaff to See how much Xp she has until the next level!

There is also only a single bookcase, The strange bookcase, where most of this mod's crafting will take place!

This mod also now adds elemental effects such as freezing in a blizzard or melting in the underworld without decent equipment. Saria will help you fight off these elements but if she is in a biome she is weak in
you will suffer whether or not you have the right equipment!
Staying in a biome she is weak in will make Saria grow ill much faster so be sure not to linger for too long!

This mod adds a few soundtracks from other games, some of which are from terraria otherworld, DarkCloud, and Ocarina of Time. This was also my first mod, but honestly I'm really happy with how it turned out so far!

The Upgrade progression order for this mod is as follows:
~Strange : Uses the move Psyshock
~Sapphire : Uses the move ColdSoul
~Ruby : Uses the move Eruption
~Topaz : Uses the move ThunderClash
~Emerald : Uses the move GemStorm
~Amber : Uses the move AttackOrder
~Amethyst : Uses the move ShadowSneak
        More on these attacks will be shown as you level up!

		I also highly advise using the Recipe Browser created by jopojelly to see all the different crafting recipes and items, however, this mod does also include notes for most items at the StrangeBookcase. Start by just crafting a PaperNote.
	Please do keep note that these level ups will get extremely expensive, however, the effort put into it will certainly pay off!
					This mod will be updated to Terraria 1.4 once finished on 1.3
		If you discover any bugs or issues please let me know as multiplayer functions differently than single player. My discord is ~David~ #5797
