Saria comes from another world in order to help you on your adventure!
She is a powerful summon that offers a plethera of abilities beyond just combat AND each of these abilities have strengths and weaknesses depending on what biome the player is in! 

New recipes for vanilla potions through the use of cooking pots and this mods XPpearls.

Create XPpearls from the money dropped by enemies and use them at one of the mods themed bookshelves to upgrade Saria into a stronger form to change her ability.

This mod adds a few soundtracks from other games, some of which are from terraria otherworld, DarkCloud, and Ocarina of Time. This was also my first mod, but honestly I'm really happy with how it turned out so far!

The Upgrade progression order for this mod is as follows:
~Strange : Uses the move Psyshock
~Sapphire : Uses the move ColdSoul
~Ruby : Uses the move Eruption
~Topaz : Uses the move ThunderClash
~Emerald : Uses the move GemStorm
~Amber : Uses the move AttackOrder
~Amethyst : Uses the move ShadowSneak
~Diamond : Uses the move Moonblast
        More on these attacks and what they do in their item descriptions!

		I also highly advise using the Recipe Browser created by jopojelly to see all the different crafting recipes and items, however, this mod does also include notes for each item at each of the themed bookshelves. Start by just crafting a PaperNote.
	Please do keep note that these upgrades will get extremely expensive, however, the effort put into it will certainly pay off!
					This mod will be updated to Terraria 1.4 once finished on 1.3
